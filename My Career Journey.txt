I started my career journey quite late at the age of 24 years as a Primary school teacher within our neighourhood, at first, I enjoyed what I was doing,  I mean, there was little or no stress at work.My daily routine took a linear line, Home -School- School...Just before I knew it I was a year down the teaching lane.
I then moved to a new city "Lagos", my perspective about life changed gradually,  I made friends who were way younger than me, and were high achievers as sucessful entrepreneurs, Software developers, Bank Tellers, Nurses and the likes.
I realized that I could do more, yes more!! I mean better!
I knew I had to hone my skills, push my myself, do something extraodinary, maybe something I haven't tried before, something that could make me more fulfilled, learn more, fight more and pray harder.
All these things I did and still doing. I won't relent, although there are tornados, thongs and strains along my path, but I am holding on, standing firm, believing and trusting God so hard in becoming the wowan I want...
